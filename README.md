## Description
Pantry Pal is a personal project where a user can input ingredients and get meals and recipes given back. 
I used OpenAI API to integrate AI to get the recipes based on the users input. 

For this Full stack project I used Next.js with Typescript for the frontend and Express.js for the backend. 
I then used tailwind to design the frontend. 
I have added a .env file so the api key is secure and used dotenv so the key is automatically used.
